# Project - Travel App API Project Spec


## Overview

We will be building a trip planning app that stores a list of trips for a user.
The goal of this project is for you to practice everything you have learnt about building an API.

## The Spec

### The API

Your API should contain/use:

1. a relational database to store all our trips.(SQL, Postgres)
2. a trips resource - you should be able to create, list, show, and destroy trips.
3. completed trips are marked as completed.


### Routes and Actions

Create unit tests for and then implement the following new routes:

- POST   /trips
    - creates new trip
- GET    /tasks
    - list all trips
- GET    /trips/<id>
    - show a trip with a specified id
- PUT
    - updates a trip
- DELETE /trips/<id>
    - destroys a trip with a specified id
